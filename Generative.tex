\section{Generative Adversarial Networks}

\subsection{Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images using Adversarial Training \cite{shrivastava2016learning}} 

Learning from synthetic images often does not achieve the desired performenace due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions. 

\begin{itemize}

    \item Propose simulated + unsupervised learning that uses unlabelled real data to refine synthetic images
    \item Train a refiner network to add realism to synthetic images using a combination of adversarial and self-regularization loss
    \item Modify GAN to stabilize training and reduce artifacts
    \item Show improved realism and state-of-the-art results on training deep neural networks

\end{itemize}
