This repo is an attempt at more structured note taking. 
- Material from research papers and talks is sorted by subject rather than by author
- Textbooks are assigned their own separate files

<b>DL_Text</b>: Notes that I'm making as I read through the textbook on Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. They were meant to 'reinforce my learning' and enable easy revision. Hopefully, they can be of benefit to other readers as well.

<b>Visualizations</b>: Notes on subjects related to visualization and interpretability of models. A common discussion point during presentations.
